# LinkedIn Post - The Silent Cartographer

**I built a system that turns my Kindle highlights into a second brain**

After years of highlighting books and forgetting everything, I built The Silent Cartographer - a tool that transforms Kindle exports into structured knowledge.

**The problem:** I'd highlight 200+ passages per book. They'd sit in Kindle forever. Zero retention.

**The solution:** A color-coded system where each highlight color triggers different AI processing:
- Yellow = Key concepts -> Obsidian notes with philosophical frameworks
- Pink = Action items -> Asana tasks with context
- Blue = Beautiful quotes -> Preserved for inspiration
- Orange = Disagreements -> Captured with space for my response

**What makes it different:**

The AI doesn't just summarize. Each concept gets analyzed through 9 lenses: Trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric), Hegelian dialectic, polarity thinking, Socratic questioning, scientific method, kairos (timing), connections to existing knowledge, practical applications, and open questions.

It knows my profile - my work at Hermes AI, my family goals, my faith - so it scores relevance and personalizes applications.

Built-in spaced repetition reminds me to review concepts at scientifically-proven intervals (1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 90 days).

**Tech stack:** Python, Claude API, Asana API, Obsidian, BeautifulSoup for parsing Kindle's quirky HTML exports.

6 months of building. Now every book I read becomes searchable, actionable knowledge.

The gap between reading and knowing is a system, not willpower.
