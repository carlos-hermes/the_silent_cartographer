## Project Overview

**The Silent Cartographer** transforms Kindle highlights into a structured Obsidian knowledge vault with AI-powered concept extraction, Asana task creation, and spaced repetition learning.

### Core Workflow
1. Read on Kindle, color-code highlights
   - Yellow = concepts
   - Pink = actions
   - Blue = quotes
   - Orange = disagreements
2. Export as HTML, run `tsc process`
3. AI extracts top concepts and actions using Claude
4. Generates Obsidian notes with 9-part philosophical framework
5. Creates Asana tasks from actionable insights
6. Tracks concepts for spaced repetition review

### The 9-Part Framework
1. **Trivium** - Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric
2. **Dialectic** - Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis
3. **Polarity Thinking** - Tensions and false dichotomies
4. **Socratic Method** - Questions that challenge assumptions
5. **Scientific Method** - Evidence and testability
6. **Kairos** - Timing and context
7. **Connections** - Links to existing knowledge
8. **Applications** - Personalized practical uses
9. **Open Questions** - What's still unresolved

### Tech Stack
- Python
- Claude API
- Asana API
- BeautifulSoup
- Rich CLI
- Sentence-transformers
